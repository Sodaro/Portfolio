# About me
I have been interested in game development for a long time. While I had
programmed prior to starting uni, it was during my time studying for a
bachelor in Game Design that I realized that programming was what I
actually wanted to do for a living. I try my best to be programming
language and game-engine agnostic, as some are better suited for certain tasks than others, and they all come with their own pros & cons.

As a person I strive to always improve and not stagnate.
As a team-member I help others if I am able, and care more about what is best for the group or game rather than sit in isolation and focus on my own stuff.
