            I have been interested in game development for a long time. My first
            experience was with Valve's "Hammer" Editor, but I later moved to
            GameMaker and Unity where I started to learn how to program. In
            university, I initially studied Game Design, but it was during my
            time there that I realized programming was what I enjoyed most about
            developing games.

            I've made it a personal goal to be programming language and game-engine
            agnostic, as some are better suited for certain tasks than others, and
            they all come with their own pros & cons. I strive to always improve
            upon my own skills, and like to try different approaches to problems
            I have encountered before. In a team I try to help out whenever I have
            time, as solving problems together is both fun and an opportunity to
            learn something new!
